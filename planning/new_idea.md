1. you can create your api and start getting paid
--> upload ur api link and the parameters it takes
--> it creates a x402 api on our server
--> it creates a new token on base
--> the pricing of ur api is dynamic based on the token

2. people can see all apis on the market place
drag and drop interface to chain apis together, take parameters from one and outputs from one and put into inputs of next

3. total quoted price created

cool ux

steps to create
1. SERVER THAT PRICE / ROUTE UPDATES DYNAMIC
create a server that we can 
 -- add new routes that are 402 on run time
 -- have dynamic pricing for these 402 

2. frontend with one button that
-- creates token on base
-- creates new api on our server
-- links api to token
another button to
-- buy that api and get result



you can chain together any apis on our site
